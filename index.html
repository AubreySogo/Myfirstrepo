    <h2><u>Welcome to my online portfolio! &#128513</u></h2>

    <p>I’m Aubrey, a passionate graphic designer with a love for creativity and innovation. 
    I’m excited to share my work with you!</p>

<p>On this website, you’ll find a curated selection of my projects that showcase my skills in branding, illustration, and digital design. 
Each piece tells a story—my goal is to not just create beautiful visuals, but to solve problems and communicate ideas effectively.</p>

<p>As you explore, you’ll see my design process in action. From initial sketches to the final product, I’ve included case studies that highlight the challenges I faced and the strategies I employed to overcome them.
I want you to understand the thought and care that goes into each project.</p>

<p>Feel free to navigate through different sections, check out my favorite projects, and learn more about my approach to design. 
If you have any questions or just want to chat about design, don’t hesitate to reach out through the contact page.</p>

<p>Thanks for visiting, and I hope you enjoy exploring my work as much as I enjoyed creating it!&hearts;</p>
